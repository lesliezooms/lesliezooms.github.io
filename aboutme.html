This is about me
Hi my name is Leslie Navarro. I am 15 currently living in the San Fransico Area. <br>
I am Latina with both of my parents being immagarnts from Mexico.<br>
 I have two older brother who ages are 21 and 27 ( we are all 6 years apart)
<br>
When it comes to my personality and characteristic, I define myself as really mixed.<br>
 Although I am really loud when it comes to my friends, I am also really quiet.<br>
  I treasure my alone time. Every since I was five I loved being alone.<br>
   I often enjoy journaling and listening to music!!<body>
